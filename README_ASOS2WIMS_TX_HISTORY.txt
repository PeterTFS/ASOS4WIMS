To make the program working, need to install required libraries including pandas, I used "pip install pandas" for easy installation,
however, sometime it will have some trouble, a trouble shooting page on stackoverflow (link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4750806/how-to-install-pip-on-windows)
can help.

You can easily run this programe by input following cmd in a shell cmd:
    python ASOS2WIMS_TX_HISTORY.py
